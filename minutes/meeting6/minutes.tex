Martin Boissier, Hugo Hutt

\section{Topics}

\begin{itemize}
\item Discussion of the experiments and the statistics data extracted
  from the algorithm.
\item The performance of the evolved ant was discussed and also how it
  compares with the performance of the rule-based ants.
\item Discussion of the effects caused by modifying the algorithm
  parameters and how this is shown on the generated graphs.
\item The human-competitiveness of the algorithm and how this could be
  improved was discussed.
\end{itemize}

\section{Decisions}

Decided on the experiments and graphs to be included in the report and
also discussed the project as a whole, such as how the final
implementation compares with the initial predictions.
