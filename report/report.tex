As part of the ECMM409 team project, we decided to work on one the
GECCO 2007 competion problems : Ant Wars.\\

This game, involving two opponent ants, takes place on a square
toroidal grid of dimension 11x11. Initially, 15 pieces of food are
randomly generated and placed on the game board, the respective
coordinates of the ants are (5, 2) and (5, 8). Playing successively,
the ants are allowed to move one step in every direction including
diagonal movements : (NW, N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W). If an ant enters a
cell containing a piece of food, a point is added to its score,
however if ant enters an the adverse cell, the opponent is killed and
cannot play anymore. The game lasts at at most 35 moves per
player. The score being only based on the number of pieces of food
eaten, the ants have to collect as much food as possible from their
environment.\\

The aim of this project was to find the best algorithm representating
a winning ant behaviour we could, using a nature inspired approach,
and we decided to use a strongly-typed genetic programming algorithm
to design our ant.\\

First, this short report will analyse and explain the choice of
genetic programming amongst the numerous nature inspired algorithms to
design our artificial ant. Then, the detail of the algorithm will be
presented, followed by an explanation on the framework implementation
using Haskell. Finally, the results of our computations will be
presented.

\section{Road Map}

From the onset of the project, a road map was defined, clearly
identifying the important steps that would have to be completed. Of
course, this list of tasks was slightly updated throughout the
project, to take into account some difficulties related to the
implementation or to the unexpected results of some experiments.

\begin{itemize}
\item implement the framework
\item find and implement rule-based ants
\item run experiments on the ants, evaluate the performances with a tournament
\item implement a memory module to the ants and test its influence on the performances
\item design and implement a genetic programming algorithm
\item conduct experiments on the algorithm parameters
\item graphs on the evolution of the best genetic ant, generation after generation
\end{itemize}
